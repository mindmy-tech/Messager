 Server Setup

- [x] Server 
- [ ] Client

> In CMD

### Open **Cmd / Terminal ** and navigate to your *location* 

> Run these Comands Below

`cd .\Server\`

`pip install -r .\requirements.txt`

 if this doen't work try **pip3** instead of **pip**

`python .\server.py`


## And now your server is running 


### And Now For Client

- [ ] Server 
- [x] Client

#### Open Cmd / Terminal 

> Run these Comands Below

`cd .\Client\`

### Sockes  

Sockets provide the necessary framework for network 
communication in our messaging application. so I used sockets 

### Pyqt5

PyQt5 is a powerful GUI toolkit for Python, offering a wide range of widgets and
 tools to create visually appealing user interfaces. With PyQt5, we can design the layout of our messaging application, implement interactive features, and handle user interactions.

I created the gui on pyqt5 designer and converted into a ui file 
and in python i acessed it

## Conclution

Building a messaging application using Python, sockets, and PyQt5 allows us to create a versatile and feature-rich platform for seamless communication. With the power of Python, we can leverage sockets to establish network connections, enabling real-time messaging capabilities. PyQt5 enhances the user experience by providing an interactive and visually appealing graphical interface.

Title: Building a Messaging Application with Python, Sockets, and PyQt5

Introduction:
In the world of modern communication, messaging applications play a crucial role in connecting people across the globe. In this essay, we will explore the process of building a messaging application using Python, leveraging sockets for low-level networking, and PyQt5 for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). This combination of technologies allows us to develop a powerful and user-friendly messaging platform.

Python:
Python, a versatile and powerful programming language, serves as the foundation for our messaging application. Its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries make it an ideal choice for rapid development. With Python, we can implement various functionalities required for a messaging application, including socket communication and GUI development.

Sockets:
Sockets provide the necessary framework for network communication in our messaging application. By utilizing the socket module in Python, we can establish connections, send and receive data, and handle network-related operations. Sockets enable real-time communication between clients and servers, making it an essential component for our messaging platform.

Low-Level Networking:
Low-level networking involves the direct interaction with network protocols and communication channels. In our messaging application, we utilize sockets to establish connections using TCP/IP or UDP protocols. This allows for reliable and efficient data transmission over the network, enabling seamless messaging capabilities.

PyQt5:
PyQt5 is a powerful GUI toolkit for Python, offering a wide range of widgets and tools to create visually appealing user interfaces. With PyQt5, we can design the layout of our messaging application, implement interactive features, and handle user interactions. The combination of Python and PyQt5 enables us to create a responsive and user-friendly interface for our messaging platform.
