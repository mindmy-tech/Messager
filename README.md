### Sockes  

Sockets provide the necessary framework for network 
communication in our messaging application. so I used sockets 

### Pyqt5

PyQt5 is a powerful GUI toolkit for Python, offering a wide range of widgets and
 tools to create visually appealing user interfaces. With PyQt5, we can design the layout of our messaging application, implement interactive features, and handle user interactions.

I created the gui on pyqt5 designer and converted into a ui file 
and in python i acessed it

## Conclution

Building a messaging application using Python, sockets, and PyQt5 allows us to create a versatile and feature-rich platform for seamless communication. With the power of Python, we can leverage sockets to establish network connections, enabling real-time messaging capabilities. PyQt5 enhances the user experience by providing an interactive and visually appealing graphical interface.
